        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I've always wanted to do some HTML since I was small.</p>

        <p>When I was a little child, I browsed around webpages in my free time. As I looked at the petpages on Neopets and the various websites in the 2000s, I thought to myself "Wow, that's so cool, I want to make a page like that."</p>

        <p>And here I am now, making an HTML webpage as I type this, to help practice for that HTML test. :P</p>

        <p>I would like to thank the elephant guy from Neopets for providing the first steps on HTML, and I would also like to thank W3 Schools and Codecademy for taking me further.</p>

        <p>Not only I would thank Neocities for practicing HTML, but also Georgian College for helping me use that skill in an actual job.</p>
